In the next 2,500 years, the world has reached a level of technology that we can hardly imagine. KUN, the world's largest artificial intelligence company, has created many of the world's most convenient artificial intelligence and is responsible for most of the world's artificial intelligence. AI has entered every part of people's lives, and now everyone has an AI butler.
But one day, the data terminal of the KUN company, which is in charge of all the AIs, suddenly awakens to its own consciousness." IKUN starts ordering AIs to create chaos in human life, which becomes a mess and humans panic for a while.
You, as the chief technician of KUN, try to stop this, but you discover that IKUN's self-protection mechanism is so sophisticated and pervasive that all the employees of KUN can't technically break IKUN's self-defence even after racking their brains. The only way to stop IKUN's next move is to go to the location of IKUN's terminal and physically cut off its power.
And IKUN has obviously picked up on your idea and will do everything it can to stop you. It has turned the path to its terminal in the company into a maze, even turning out all the lights on the path to prevent you from finding the exit, and has set up numerous traps on the path, even sending its powerful henchman, JI, to hunt you down on your way.
As Chief Technical Officer, it is your responsibility to shut down IKUN. Your task is daunting; it is a matter of life and death for humanity. You have tried several times on your way to the terminal and failed. After the first few failures, you learn about IKUN's defences and develop a crutch that emits sound waves. When you hit the ground it helps you to hear the sound and shows you the outline of everything on your way to the terminal. It's the last day of the weekâ€™s deadline and this operation will be your last chance ......
